# CrazeEmulate

This is an open-source Intel 8080 emulator project, written in modern C++17. The project is licensed under the GPL version 3 license, which means that any contributions are welcome.
Overview

The CrazeEmulate project is a hobby project aimed at emulating the Intel 8080 processor using modern C++17. The project is currently a work in progress, and many features are yet to be implemented. Time is short as solo student developer. However, the project already supports 153 out of 255 instructions.

## Motivation

The Intel 8080 processor is a classic microprocessor that has played a significant role in the history of computing. The CrazeEmulate project aims to bring the power of this iconic processor to modern programming languages and platforms. By emulating the Intel 8080 using C++20, we can create a platform-agnostic emulator that can run on a wide range of devices and operating systems.


## Getting Started

To get started with the CrazeEmulate project, you will need a C++20 compiler, such as g++, clang, or msvc. Once you have a compiler set up, you can clone the CrazeEmulate repository and build the emulator using the provided CMake file. You can then run the emulator and start exploring the features.
Contributing

```
cmake . && make
```

## Tests
You may run a test with : 

```
./CrazeEmulate --test
```
This will print a simple Hello and halt the CPU.

## Contributions

Contributions to the CrazeEmulate project are welcome and encouraged. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. You can also contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting new features, or helping to improve the documentation.
