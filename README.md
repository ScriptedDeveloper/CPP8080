# CrazeEmulate

This is an open-source Intel 8080 emulator project, written in modern C++17. The project is licensed under the GPL version 3 license, which means that any contributions are welcome.
Overview

The CrazeEmulate project is a hobby project aimed at emulating the Intel 8080 processor using modern C++17. The project is currently a work in progress, and many features are yet to be implemented. However, the project already supports many features, including:

-    Registers
-   MVI
-   MOV
-    Stack (PUSH, POP)
-    CALL
-    JMP
-    And many more

## Motivation

The Intel 8080 processor is a classic microprocessor that has played a significant role in the history of computing. The CrazeEmulate project aims to bring the power of this iconic processor to modern programming languages and platforms. By emulating the Intel 8080 using C++17, we can create a platform-agnostic emulator that can run on a wide range of devices and operating systems.


## Getting Started

To get started with the CrazeEmulate project, you will need a C++17 compiler, such as GCC or Clang. Once you have a compiler set up, you can clone the CrazeEmulate repository and build the emulator using the provided CMake file. You can then run the emulator and start exploring the features.
Contributing

```
cmake . && make
```
